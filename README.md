# JWT Token with Spring Boot in Kotlin

I had the issue to use JWT tokens in my current application. While there is a lot of information about it in java, I was missing an easy step by step tutorial for kotlin. And since I prefere kotlin over java a lot, I will provide this tutorial myself.

I used [this](https://auth0.com/blog/implementing-jwt-authentication-on-spring-boot/) tutorial as base for my implementation.

Because there are a lot information about [jwt](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens) and validation, I will not explain what a JSON Web Token is.
